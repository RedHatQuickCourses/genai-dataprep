= Parsing Documents with Images and Tables
:navtitle: Images and Tables

Once you convert an input document into the unified `DoclingDocument` object, you can then programatically traverse the object tree and extract items like headings, paragraphs, code blocks, images, tables, cells and textual items. 

## Pre-requisites

* The Docling Python library must be installed as outlined in the previous sections using `pip` in a Python virtual environment
* Git CLI to clone the sample data files from GitHub
* Visual Studio Code, or other editors to edit Python code

## Lab: Exporting Tables

. If you have not already done it, clone the Git repository containing the sample documents that should be converted, to a folder of your choice.
+
[source,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
--
$ *git clone https://github.com/RedHatQuickCourses/genai-apps.git*
--

. All the sample input files and code is in a folder called `dataprep`. Change to this folder in the terminal.
+
[source,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
--
$ *cd genai-apps/dataprep*
--

. If you have previously created a virtual environment and installed Docling, activate the venv.
+
[source,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
--
$ *source venv/bin/activate*
--
+
Your prompt should change to indicate that you are now running in an isolated virtual environment.

. Inspect the `export-tables.py` file in VS Code. The input document is in the `sample-data/batch` folder. The output documents will be placed in the `/tmp/export-tables` folder.
+
```python
INPUT_FILE = "sample-data/batch/2206.01062.pdf"
OUTPUT_DIR = "/tmp/export-tables/"
```

. In the `main()` method, instantiate a default `DocumentConverter` class instance and convert the input document:
+
[source,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
--
...
    doc_converter = DocumentConverter()

    conv_res = doc_converter.convert(input_file)
...
--

. On the `DoclingDocument` object, Docling provides a `tables` method that returns a list of `TableItem` objects representing all the tables in the document. We take advantage of Docling's integration with the popular `Pandas` library to export a `DataFrame` object that we can convieniently query and manipulate.
+
[source,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
--
...
for table_ix, table in enumerate(*conv_res.document.tables*):
    table_df = *table.export_to_dataframe()*
...
--

. Finally, we export the in-memory representation of the `DataFrame` objects to a CSV file.
+
```python
...
    table_df.to_csv(element_csv_filename)
...
```

. Run the program. You can safely ignore any warnings emitted. You should see some table output in markdown format.
+
[source,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
--
$ (venv) *python3 export-tables.py*
--

. Once the program completes, you should see CSV files in the `/tmp/export-tables` folder corresponding to each of the tables in the document with a `*.csv` extension.

## Lab: Exporting Images and Image Snapshots

. Inspect the code in the `export-images.py` file. The input file for this lab is `sample-data/penrose.pdf`, a document that has a number of embedded images. The images are extracted and saved to the `/tmp/export-images` folder after processing.

. In the `main()` method, we customize the pipeline by asking Docling to generate images of each page in the input document as well as extract images from it.
+
```python
...
    pipeline_options = PdfPipelineOptions()
    pipeline_options.images_scale = 2.0
    pipeline_options.generate_page_images = True
    pipeline_options.generate_picture_images = True
...
```

. Once the document is converted, we iterate over each page in the document, and take a snapshot image of each page and save it in the `/tmp/export-images` folder. Once again, Docling's native integration with the popular Python `Pillow` library provides a nice convienient abstraction for us to export the image objects to different formats.
+
[source,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
--
...
    for page_no, page in *conv_res.document.pages.items()*:
        page_no = page.page_no
        page_image_filename = output_path / f"{out_file_name}-page-{page_no}.png"

        with page_image_filename.open("wb") as fp:
            *page.image.pil_image.save(fp, format="PNG")*
...
--

. Next, we iterate over the hierarchial tree of nested objects in the `DoclingDocument` object and extract images (`PictureItem` elements) from it. We serialize each of the extracted images in the `/tmp/export-images` folder.
+
[source,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
--
...
for element, _level in conv_res.document.*iterate_items()*:
    if isinstance(element, *PictureItem*):
        picture_counter += 1
        element_image_filename = (
            output_path / f"{out_file_name}-picture-{picture_counter}.png"
        )
...
--

. Continue using the virtual environment from the previous lab. If you are not in the virtual environment, active it and then run the `export-images.py` file.
+
[source,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
--
$ (venv) *python3 export-images.py*
--

. Verify that the extracted page images and the individual images in the document are exported in the `/tmp/export-images` folder.
