# Using the Docling CLI
:navtitle: Docling CLI

You can use the Docling CLI to convert documents from and to various supported formats. This is useful for prototyping and experimentation with different kinds of documents that you want to index and use in your RAG pipelines for your Gen AI applications.

The complete list of commands and the corresponding options supported are available at https://docling-project.github.io/docling/reference/cli

## Pre-requisites

* Docling CLI must be installed as outlined in the previous section using `pip`
* Git CLI to clone the sample data files from GitHub

## Lab: Using the Docling CLI

. If you have not already done so, clone the Git repository containing the sample documents that should be converted to a folder of your choice. If you have completed the previous lab, then there is a need to do this step.
+
[source,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
--
$ *git clone https://github.com/RedHatQuickCourses/genai-apps.git*
--

. All the sample input files and code is in a folder called `dataprep`. Change to this folder in the terminal.
+
[source,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
--
$ *cd genai-apps/dataprep*
--

. If you have completed the previous lab and created a virtual environment and installed Docling, activate the venv.
+
[source,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
--
$ *source venv/bin/activate*
--
+
Your prompt should change to indicate that you are now running in an isolated virtual environment

. Verify that Docling is installed in the venv
+
[source,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
--
$ (venv) *pip3 list | grep docling*
docling                   2.36.1
docling-core              2.34.1
docling-ibm-models        3.4.4
docling-parse             4.0.3
--

. Run the `docling` CLI command to convert a PDF. When you run the `docling` command for the first time, it will take a while to download and cache a few pre-trained models from the Hugging Face model repository (These specialized models are used to identify and extract tables, images, and layout information from documents). Subsequent runs will be approximately 50% faster.
+

--
$ (venv) *docling --output /tmp/ sample-data/docling-rpt.pdf*
--
+
The default output format is __Markdown__. The output is saved to an .md file in the location specified by the `--output` flag.

. Verify that a file with the same name, but with an `.md` extension is created in the `/tmp` folder. You can preview the Markdown file in Visual Studio Code or some other previewer.

. You can output to a different format by passing the `--to` flag with the output format required. For example, to get JSON output:
+
[source,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
--
$ (venv) *docling --to json --output /tmp/ sample-data/docling-rpt.pdf*
--

. Verify the JSON output in the `/tmp` folder

. Now, let's try to convert an MS Word document to Markdown.
+
[source,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
--
$ (venv) *docling --output /tmp/ sample-data/msword-sample.docx*
--
+
image::msword-out.png[title=MS Word file to Markdown Preview]
+
Notice how Docling has identified the layout and table structure in the input MS Word document and correctly converted it to Markdown.

. Finally, let's try to convert an MS Powerpoint document to Markdown.
+
[source,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
--
$ (venv) *docling --output /tmp/ sample-data/ppt-sample.pptx*
WARNING:docling.backend.mspowerpoint_backend:Warning: image cannot be loaded by Pillow: cannot find loader for this WMF file
--
+
image::ppt-converted.png[title=MS Powerpoint file to Markdown Preview]
+
Docling has identified the layout and structure in the input document and correctly converted it to Markdown. Each slide is converted into a Markdown heading, and the content in the slides is placed under the corresponding headings. Bullets in the slides are converted to lists in the Markdown. You can safely ignore the warning about Docling not being able to parse an embedded WMF file in the slides.

. You can also pass a URL containing a document instead of a local path to the document. For example,
+
[source,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
--
$ (venv) *docling -vv --output /tmp/ https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.09869*

## Optional Lab: Explore the different options in the Docling CLI

You can test the Docling CLI with your own PDF and MS Office format documents. Experiment with different input and output formats. Refer to the https://docling-project.github.io/docling/reference/cli[Docling CLI reference] for the complete list of CLI options.

TIP: Use the `-v` flag or the `-vv` flag for verbose debugging output. It will help you troubleshoot if there are parsing failures with documents.

WARNING: Do not forget to run the `docling` command in the virtual environment you created earlier. Docling is not installed in the system `PATH`.
