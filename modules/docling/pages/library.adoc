# Using Docling as a Library
:navtitle: Docling Library

The Docling CLI and web UI are meant to be used for simple use-cases and for experimenting with documents. The most common way to use Docling in the real-world is as a library to build custom pipelines and integrate with other systems as part of a larger pre-training, fine-tuning, or RAG workflow.

This section is a brief introduction to using Docling as a Python library to programmatically perform document conversions. This is only a basic introduction. Subsequent chapters will deal extensively with Docling features like chunking, custom pipelines, and serialization.

## Pre-requisites

* Docling CLI must be installed as outlined in the previous sections using `pip` in a Python virtual environment
* Git CLI to clone the sample data files from GitHub
* Visual Studio Code, or other editors, to edit Python code

## Lab: Simple Document Conversion

. If you have not already done it, clone the Git repository containing the sample documents that should be converted to a folder of your choice.
+
[source,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
--
$ *git clone https://github.com/RedHatQuickCourses/genai-apps.git*
--

. All the sample input files and code are in a folder called `dataprep`. Change to this folder in the terminal.
+
[source,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
--
$ *cd genai-apps/dataprep*
--

. If you have previously created a virtual environment and installed Docling, activate the venv.
+
[source,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
--
$ *source venv/bin/activate*
--
+
Your prompt should change to indicate that you are now running in an isolated virtual environment.

. Inspect the `simple-conversion.py` file in VS Code.
+
```python
from docling.document_converter import DocumentConverter

source = "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.09869"  # document URL

converter = DocumentConverter()
doc = converter.convert(source).document

print(doc.export_to_markdown())
```

. Run the program. You can safely ignore any warnings emitted. You should see that the program downloaded the PDF and converted it into Markdown.

. If you are using an IDE like Visual Studio Code, you can mouse over the `doc` string in Line 6. Notice that it is of type `DoclingDocument`. This object is a runtime representation of the structure and content of the input document. You can then export this object into various output formats, or do some processing on the structure of the input document and then output content.

. On `Line 8` in the code sample, delete the `.export_to_markdown()` method text and enter a `.` ("dot") after the `doc` object. The IDE offers you a number of methods that can be invoked.

. Select the `export_to_text()` method and read the documentation for the method. Note that it provides some options to control the amount of output text. Change `Line 8` in the sample code to look like the following:
+
[source,python,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
--
...

print(doc.*export_to_text(from_element=0, to_element=10))*
--

. Run the program again, and note that the output is restricted to around 10 lines from the output text.
