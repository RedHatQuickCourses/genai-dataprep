= Data Preparation for Gen AI Applications
:navtitle: Home

== Introduction

This course equips students with the knowledge and practical skills to use **Docling** for efficiently converting and preparing unstructured document data for various AI tasks, particularly for fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs), and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) applications.

**Target Audience:** Data scientists, AI engineers, solution architects, consultants, and developers who work with unstructured document data, and need to prepare it for AI model training, fine-tuning, or information retrieval.

**Duration:** 2 hours

== Objectives

On completing this course, you should be able to:

* Understand the challenges of unstructured document data and the role of Docling in addressing them.
* Install, configure, and use Docling via its Python API and command line interface (CLI).
* Master the conversion of various document formats (PDF, DOCX, HTML) into Docling's structured **DoclingDocument** format.
* Effectively navigate and utilize the **DoclingDocument** object to access text, layout, and metadata.
* Implement document chunking strategies using Docling to prepare data for LLMs.
* Be prepared to apply Docling to real-world document data preparation tasks.
* Integrate Docling into AI pipelines, particularly for **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)** with frameworks like **LangChain** and **LlamaIndex**.
